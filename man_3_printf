.SH NAME
_printf
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"

.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf produces output according to a format string. It will write output
to standard out.

_printf function prototype:

int _printf(const char *format, ...)

.SS Return value
Upon  successful  return,  _printf returns the number of characters
printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
If error occurs, _printf will return a negative value.

.SS Format of the format string
The format string is a character string.The format string is composed of:
ordinary character (not%) which are copied unchanced to the output string and
conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more
subsequent arguments.  Each conversion  specification  is  introduced  by  the
character  %, and ends with a conversion specifier.  In between there may be
(in this order) zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width,
an optional precision and an optional length modifier.

"%%" formats do not consume an argument, it will just print a single "%".

.SS The conversion specifiers
       The character % is followed by the following specifiers:

       c If  no  l modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an
       unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
       s If no l modifier is present: The const char * argument is expected to
       be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer  to a string).
       Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a
       terminating null byte ('\0'); if a precision is specified, no more than
       the number specified are written.  If a precision is given, no
       null  byte  need  be  present;  if the precision is not specified, or is
       greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a
       terminating null byte.
       i The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
       d The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

.SS The flag characters
       The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:
       #      The value should be converted to an "alternate form".
       ' '    (a space) A blank should be left before a positive number
       (or empty string) produced by a signed conversion.
       +      A sign (+ or -) should always be placed before a number produced
       by a signed conversion.  By default a  sign  is used only for negative
       numbers.  A + overrides a space if both are used.

.SH EXAMPLES
Use _printf to print a string with variables of different types

#include "main.h"

	  int main (void)

           {

                float dollars = 673.14, euros = 655.60;
                char *CFA = "Central African CFA franc";

                    printf("Converting euro and dollar into %s :\n\n1euro = %f %s\n1dollar = %f %s\n", CFA, euros, CFA, dollars, CFA);

                                  return (0);
  
                                  }
